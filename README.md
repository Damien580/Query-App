# Query-App

This app is a basic command line web search app.
It takes in a topic and returns the corresponding wikipedia page opened in a new tab on your browser. 
The app then asks if there are any more questions, and allows for the input of text to ask the question.
A google search is performed, the top result is returned and opened in a tab on the browser.
